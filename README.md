# BERT_QA_Model

This repository tackles the NLP task of Question Answering (QA) using the BERT language model. In QA, the model receives a context and a question as input and extracts the answer from the given context.

## Repository Contents

1. **`QA_model_with_BERT.pdf`**  
   A detailed report describing the project, including the model architecture, training process, usage instructions, and additional insights.

2. **`BERT_QA_Model.ipynb`**  
   A Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training and evaluating the model.

3. **`BERT_QA_ModelTesting.ipynb`**  
   A Jupyter Notebook for testing the trained model on different examples.

## Suggested Workflow

For a better understanding, it is recommended to first read the **report** to get an overview of the project and then proceed to explore and run the **code**.
